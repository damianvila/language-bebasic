# Atom syntax highlighting for Basic Engine BASIC

Syntax Highlight for [BASIC Engine BASIC](http://basicengine.org/manual.html) for the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io).
Based on [Atom BASIC syntax highlighting for the C64](https://atom.io/packages/language-cbmbasic) by [Steven J. Syrek](https://github.com/sjsyrek).

This syntax highlighter supports the BASIC available in the [BASIC Engine](http://basicengine.org/) Single Board Computer.

## What is the BASIC Engine computer?

The [BASIC Engine](https://github.com/uli/basicengine-pcb) is a very low-cost single-board home computer with advanced 2D color graphics and sound capabilities, roughly comparable to late-1980s or early-1990s computers and video game consoles. It can be built at home without special skills or tools and using readily available components for under 10 Euros in parts, or mass-produced for even less.
